# HLUG Events

  Houston Linux User Group hosts a number of events.  Tyipcally these break
  down into one of two categories.

## Lab Meetings

  These meetings involve bringing your projects to show-and-tell.  They also
  encourage brining hardware which requires debugging of Linux-related issues,
  or just brining questions to share with the group.

## Social Meetings

  These meeting involve eating and drinking in the company of Linux minded
  people.  The topics rarely stay on Linux proper, but flow with whatever the
  group is interested in at the moment.  It's a great way to network with Linux
  loving peers.
